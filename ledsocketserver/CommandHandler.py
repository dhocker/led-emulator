class CommandHandler:
    """
    Handles commands sent by a network client.

    The protocol is very simple (loosely based on the mpd (music player daemon) protocol).
    The client sends a command line terminated by a newline (\n). In this case, the command line
    consists of a command and any number of operands.
    The command handler parses the command line into into its constituent parts.
    The command handler executes the command a returns a JSON formatted response.
    The response is one line, terminated with a newline.
    The JSON payload is a dictionary. The following properties appear in all responses.
        command: the command for which the response was generated
        result: OK or ERROR
    The remainder of the response is command dependent.

    Examples
    Client sends:
        scriptfiles\n
    Server responds:
        {"command": "scriptfiles", "result": "OK", "scriptfiles": ["definitions.dmx", "test-end.dmx", "test.dmx"]}\n

    Client sends:
        bad-command\n
    Server responds:
        {"command": "bad-command", "result": "ERROR", "messages": ["Unrecognized command"]}\n

    The easiest way to experiment with the client is to use telnet. Simply open
    a connection and type commands.
